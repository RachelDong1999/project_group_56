## Function Description
There are two Jupyter notebooks analyzing the dataset that consists of calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergency service.
### Top10
 In this Jupyter notebook, we analyzed what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in ZIP 10025, and calculate how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020.
### Parking
In this Jupyter notebook, we analyze whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in our ZIP code 10025 than they are in general. The result shows our region has a lower fraction.
